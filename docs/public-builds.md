# How the manual is built for the website

The manual and all of its translations is automatically rebuilt and
made available at PHP.net through a regular process handled by the
systems team.

Currently, this happens every few hours.

If there appear to be problems with the regular building of the manual or
any translation, contact the [PHP Systems team](mailto:systems@php.net)
for help. (The process is automated and monitored, so problems are
generally dealt with promptly.)

## CHM builds
Right now, nobody knows when or how the CHM builds are made.
